## A Group-based Many-task Collaborative Optimization Framework for Evolutionary Robots Design

In evolutionary robotics (ER), employing evolutionary algorithms to simulate biological evolution has proven effective in assisting designers in addressing complex robotic challenges. It is noteworthy that the evolution of a robot's morphology or controller often entails tackling an extensive number of tasks. The use of evolutionary multitasking with ER could improve the performance of problem-solving (i.e., the quality of solutions to each task), owing to the reuse of potentially useful knowledge across diverse tasks. This study introduces a novel framework, termed adaptive group-based collaborative optimization, tailored for handling optimization problems involving a large number of tasks within the ER domain. The proposed framework divides tasks into groups according to their similarity and then proceeds through two principal stages, namely, group separation and group reunion. During the group separation stage, an adaptive crossover-operator selection method enables source tasks to share and impart useful knowledge to the target task, bolstering the exploration of the overall search space. During the group reunion stage, an adaptive knowledge combination strategy facilitates the target task in assimilating multi-source instrumental knowledge, by either mutating themselves or drawing from other tasks in the same group. We validated the efficacy of the proposed framework in both planar manipulators and hexapod robot experiments. The empirical results underscore that our method surpasses existing state-of-the-art algorithms in solving evolutionary robot design problems with a large number of tasks.
